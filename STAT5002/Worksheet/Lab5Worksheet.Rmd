# Simulating Chance


## Simulating an unfair die (sample with replacement)

A six-sided die is loaded in such a way that every even number is twice as likely to occur as every odd
number. The die is tossed once.

(A) Fill out the following probability distribution.

---

| $X$| 1   | 2   | 3  | 4   | 5   | 6   |
|:---|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
|Probability    |  |  |  |  |  |  |
---

(B) What is the probability that a number (strictly) less than 4 occurs?

    
(C) Simulate (B) using 10,000 experiments.

```{r}
# Write your code here


```


## MATH1005 Data (optional, sample without replacement)

In Semester 2 2022, MATH1005 had 928 students. In the MATH1005 survey data set, we only have 281 observations.
Hence, we only have a sample of the  MATH1005 cohort  in S2, 2022.

Using a simulation we will solve the following exercise:

- **Assume that, out of the 928 students, 427 are female and 501 are male. When picking randomly 281 students out of 928, what is the probability that more than 50% of the sample are female?**

To do this, implement the following steps:

- Use the ``sample`` function to draw without replacement a sample of 281 from a population with 427 `1`'s and 501 `0`'s.  Call it ``my.sample``.
    - *Hint 1: Use ``?sample`` to open the help file of the sample function*.
    - *Hint 2: The population (x) can be written as ``c(rep(1,427), rep(0,501))``*.
    
```{r}
### modify the following code
# here is my example of a different population with 500 1s and 500 0s
population = c(rep(1,500), rep(0,500))
# here is my example of drawing 200
my.sample = sample(population,200)
```

- Apply the ``mean`` function on ``my.sample``. This gives you the proportion of `1`'s (= females) in your draw.  Call the result ``prop.female``.

```{r}
### Write your code here

```

- Write ``female.5 = prop.female > 0.5``. The variable `female.5` tells you whether more than 50% are female in the draw (`TRUE`) or not (`FALSE`).

```{r}
### Write your code here

```

- Create a function for one draw:

```{r}
drawing = function(){
  ### Write your code here
  
}           
```

- Type `drawing()` and get the result of one draw. You can press the "Run current chunk" button several times.

```{r}
drawing()
```
- It seems that `FALSE` (i.e. less than 50% are female) happens quite often.

- Use the ``replicate`` function to repeat the draw 10,000 times. Call the result ``drawings`` (type  `` drawings = replicate(10000,drawing()) `` )
- Note: you can use `set.seed` function to make your results reproducible. Why are the results not reproducible otherwise?

```{r}
### Write your code here

```

- Take the mean of ``drawings`` via the ``mean`` function. 
```{r}
### Write your code here

```
- The result is the desired probability. That is, **from a population of 928 students, where 427 are female, a random sample of 281 students has approximately this probability of having more than 50% females**.



# Box Model 

## <i class="fa fa-th-list"></i> Summary

The **box model** models the sum (or mean) of $n$ random draws from a population. The population is the "box", and the collection of draws forms the "sample".

(1) **The Box**

As the box represents a population, we use `popsd(box)`, where we write our own function `popsd()` to compute the "population SD" of the box:
```{r}
popsd = function(x) sqrt( mean(x^2)-(mean(x)^2))
```

|Focus|By hand|In R|Symbol |
|--------------|-----|--|-------|
|Mean of the Box|Calculate the the average| `mean(box)`|$\mu$ |
|SD of the Box|Calculate the population sd|  `popsd(box)`|$\sigma$ |

(2) **The Sample**

We can focus on either the sum (or mean) of the sample.

|Focus|Expected Value |Standard Error |
|----|----|----|
|Sum of the Sample| $n \mu$  |$\sqrt{n} \sigma$ |
|Mean of the Sample| $\mu$ |  $\sigma/\sqrt{n}$|


For each calculation, work out the answer "by hand", and then check your answers in R.

## Simple box model for multiple choice questions  {-}

Model the following scenario: the multiple choice component of your final exam contains 20 questions, each with one correct answer and three incorrect answers. A correct answer is worth 1 mark and an incorrect answer is worth 0 marks. 

Would it be unusual to pass (score at least 50% in) the multiple choice section by randomly guessing? 

**Draw the box model**

```
       |              |
	   |  0  0  0  1  |
	   +--------------+
```
## Calculate the mean and SD of the box

```{r}
# write code here

```

## Calculate the $E(S)$ and  $SE(S)$ where $S$ is the sum of draws from the box

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
# write code here

```


## How many standard errors is the observed value (the passing number of correct answers) away from the expected value? 

```{r}
# write code here

```

## Assuming the box of all possible sums has a normal shape, would it be unusual to pass by randomly guessing? 

We need to know a little more than just the expected value and standard error. If we assume in addition that the histogram of all possible sums is normal, we can use a normal approximation. What mean and SD should be used here? 

```{r}
# write code here


```

You should observe that the chance of getting 10 or more correct when randomly guessing is about 1 in 200. This is very small, so it is (in this sense) "highly unlikely" that random guessing will result in a pass.


## Statistical Thinking 1

If we decided to model the above scenario using the **mean** $\bar X$ instead of the **sum** $S$, which parts would change, and which parts would stay the same? Why?

- **Mean and SD of box**

Should they change? These are unchanged. We have the same box as before. What happen to the following?


- **$E(\bar X)$ and $SE(\bar X)$**
```{r}
# write code here

```


- **Number of SE away from expected value**

How many SE is the observed value (passing proportion) away from the expected proportion?

```{r}
# write code here

```

It should remain unchanged. In detail: now passing is getting an average of 0.5 or more.
How many SEs above the expected value is this?


## Statistical Thinking 2

- Assuming the box of all possible sums has a normal shape, would it be more or less unusual to pass the multiple choice section if there were 100 questions instead of 20?

```{r}
# write code here

```
